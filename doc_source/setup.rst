Setting Up the |sdk-cpp|

    :description:
        |sdk-cpp| prerequisites and requirements to set up the SDK.
    :keywords:

This section presents information about how to set up the |sdk-cpp| on your development platform.
    
Prerequisites
=============

To use the |sdk-cpp|, you need:

* Visual Studio 2015 or later
* *or* GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) 4.9 or later
* *or* Clang 3.3 or later

* A minimum of 4 GB of RAM

  .. note:: You need 4 GB of RAM to build some of the larger AWS clients. The SDK might fail to
     build on |EC2| instance types *t2.micro*, *t2.small*, and other small instance types due to
     insufficient memory.


Additional Requirements for Linux Systems
-----------------------------------------

To compile on Linux, you must have the header files (``-dev`` packages) for :file:`libcurl`, 
:file:`libopenssl`, :file:`libuuid`, :file:`zlib`, and, optionally, :file:`libpulse` for 
|POLlong| support. The packages are typically found by using the system's package manager.

.. topic:: To install the packages on *Debian/Ubuntu-based systems*

   ::

      sudo apt-get install libcurl4-openssl-dev libssl-dev uuid-dev zlib1g-dev libpulse-dev

.. topic:: To install the packages on *Redhat/Fedora-based systems*

   ::

      sudo dnf install libcurl-devel openssl-devel libuuid-devel pulseaudio-devel

.. topic:: To install the packages on *CentOS-based systems*

   ::

      sudo yum install libcurl-devel openssl-devel libuuid-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel

.. _setup-with-nuget:

Getting the SDK Using NuGet with Visual C++
===========================================

You can use NuGet to manage dependencies for |sdk-cpp| projects that you develop with Microsoft
Visual C++. To use this procedure, you must have `NuGet <nuget_>`_ installed on your system.

.. topic:: To use the SDK with NuGet

   #. Open your project in Visual Studio.

   #. In :guilabel:`Solution Explorer`, right-click your project name, and then choose :guilabel:`Manage
      NuGet Packages`.

   #. Select the packages to use by searching for a particular service or library name. For example,
      you could use a search term such as :userinput:`aws s3 native`. Or, because |sdk-cpp| libraries
      are named consistently, use :samp:`AWSSDKCPP-{service name}` to add a library for a particular
      service to your project.

   #. Choose :guilabel:`Install` to install the libraries and add them to your project.

When you build your project, the correct binaries are automatically included for each
runtime/architecture configuration you use |mdash| you won't need to manage these dependencies
yourself.

.. _setup-with-vcpkg:

Getting the SDK Using Vcpkg with Visual C++
===========================================
You can use vcpkg to manage dependencies for |sdk-cpp| projects that you develop with Microsoft
Visual C++. To use this procedure, you must have `vcpkg <https://github.com/Microsoft/vcpkg>`_
installed on your system.

.. topic:: To use the SDK with vcpkg

   #. Open a Windows command prompt and navigate to the vcpkg directory.

   #. Integrate vcpkg into Visual Studio. You can `integrate 
      <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cpp/vcpkg#installation>`_ per project or per user. 
      The command line shown below integrates vcpkg for the current user.
      ::

	      vcpkg integrate install

   #. Install the |sdk-cpp| package. The package compiles the entire SDK and its dependencies. It 
      can take a while.
      ::

	      vcpkg install aws-sdk-cpp[*]:x86-windows --recurse

      To reduce build time, build only the SDK packages needed. Specify the package names in 
      square brackets. Also include the SDK `core` package.
      ::

         vcpkg install aws-sdk-cpp[core,s3,ec2]:x86-windows
      
      A package name can be derived from the |sdk-cpp| repo directory name for the service.
      ::

         aws-sdk-cpp\aws-cpp-sdk-<packageName>   # Repo directory name and packageName
         aws-sdk-cpp\aws-cpp-sdk-s3              # Example: Package name is s3

   #. Open your project in Visual Studio.

   #. #include the |sdk-cpp| header files you want in your source code.

Like NuGet, when you build your project, the correct binaries are automatically included for each
runtime/architecture configuration you use.

.. _setup-from-source:

Building the SDK from Source
============================

If you don't use Visual Studio (or don't want to use NuGet), you can build 
the SDK from source using command-line tools. This method also enables you 
to customize your SDK build |mdash| see :doc:`cmake-params` for the available 
options.

.. topic:: To build the SDK from source

   #. Download or clone the SDK source from :github:`aws/aws-sdk-cpp` on GitHub.

      * Direct download: :github:`aws/aws-sdk-cpp/archive/master.zip`

      * Clone with Git:

        .. container:: option

           HTTPS
              .. code-block:: sh

                 git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-cpp.git

           SSH
              .. code-block:: sh

                 git clone git@github.com:aws/aws-sdk-cpp.git

   #. Install cmake_ (*v3.2 or later*) and the relevant build tools for your 
      platform. Ensure they are available in your :envvar:`PATH`.

   #. Recommended approach: Store the generated build files outside of the 
      SDK source directory. Create a new directory to store them in. Then 
      generate the build files by running |cmake|. Specify on the |cmake| 
      command line whether to build a `Debug` or `Release` version.
      ::

         sudo mkdir sdk_build
         cd sdk_build
         sudo cmake <path/to/sdk/source> -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Release]

      Alternatively, create the build files directly in the SDK source 
      directory.
      ::

         cd <path/to/sdk/source>
         sudo cmake . -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Release]

      Building the entire SDK can take a while. To build only a particular 
      service, use the |cmake| :paramname:`BUILD_ONLY` parameter. The example 
      shown below builds only the |S3| service. For more ways to modify the 
      build output, see :doc:`cmake-params`.
      ::

         sudo cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=[Debug | Release] -DBUILD_ONLY="s3"

   #. Build the SDK binaries by running one of the following operating 
      system-dependent commands. If you're building the entire SDK, the 
      operation can take one hour or longer.

      .. container:: option

         auto make (Linux/macOS)
            .. code-block:: sh

               sudo make

         Visual Studio (Windows)
            .. code-block:: doscon

               msbuild ALL_BUILD.vcxproj

   #. Install the SDK by running one of the following operating 
      system-dependent commands.

      .. container:: option

         auto make (Linux/macOS)
            .. code-block:: sh

               sudo make install

         Visual Studio (Windows)
            .. code-block:: doscon

               rem Run this command in a command shell running in ADMIN mode
               rem The SDK is installed in `\Program Files (x86)\aws-cpp-sdk-all\`
               msbuild INSTALL.vcxproj /p:Configuration=[Debug | Release | "Debug;Release"]


Building for Android
--------------------

To build for Android, add :code:`-DTARGET_ARCH=ANDROID` to your |cmake| command line. The |sdk-cpp|
includes a |cmake| toolchain file that should cover what's needed, assuming you've set the
appropriate environment variables (:envvar:`ANDROID_NDK`).

Android on Windows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Building for Android on Windows requires additional setup. In particular, you have to run |cmake|
from a Visual Studio (2013 or later) developer command prompt. You'll also need the commands
:command:`git` and :command:`patch` in your path. If you have git installed on a Windows system,
you'll most likely find :command:`patch` in a sibling directory (:file:`.../Git/usr/bin/`).  Once
you've verified these requirements, your |cmake| command line will change slightly to use |nmake|.::

 cmake -G "NMake Makefiles" `-DTARGET_ARCH=ANDROID` <other options> ..

|nmake| builds targets in serially. To make things go more quickly, we recommend installing JOM as
an alternative to |nmake|, and then changing the |cmake| invocation as follows.::

 cmake -G "NMake Makefiles JOM" `-DTARGET_ARCH=ANDROID` <other options> ..


Creating Release Builds
-----------------------

.. container:: option

   auto make
      .. code-block:: sh

         cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release <path/to/sdk/source>
         make
         sudo make install

   Visual Studio
      .. code-block:: doscon

         cmake <path-to-root-of-this-source-code> -G "Visual Studio 12 Win64"
         msbuild INSTALL.vcxproj /p:Configuration=Release

Running Integration Tests
-------------------------

Several directory names include the suffix ``*integration-tests``. After the project is
built, the tests stored in these directories can be run to verify the project's correct 
execution.
