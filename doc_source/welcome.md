# AWS SDK for C\+\+ Developer Guide<a name="welcome"></a>

Welcome to the AWS SDK for C\+\+ Developer Guide\.

The AWS SDK for C\+\+ provides a modern C\+\+ \(version C\+\+ 11 or later\) interface for Amazon Web Services \(AWS\)\. It provides both high\-level and low\-level APIs for nearly all AWS features, minimizing dependencies and providing platform portability on Windows, macOS, Linux, and mobile\.

**Note**  
The AWS IoT SDKs and the `aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp` are separate from this SDK\. The AWS IoT Device SDK for C\+\+ v2 is available at [https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2](https://github.com/aws/aws-iot-device-sdk-cpp-v2) on GitHub\.  
For more information about AWS IoT, see [What is AWS IoT](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/iot/latest/developerguide/what-is-aws-iot.html) in the AWS IoT Developer Guide\.
