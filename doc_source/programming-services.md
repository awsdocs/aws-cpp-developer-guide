# SDK for C\+\+ code examples subset with guidance<a name="programming-services"></a>

If you are new to AWS or the AWS code examples, we recommend you start with [Getting started on code examples](getting-started-code-examples.md)\. 

This section selects several AWS services and guides you through the examples using them\. For other service examples \(but without additional guidance beyond the code\) see the next chapter [Code examples](cpp_code_examples.md)

Source code of how to work with AWS services using the AWS SDK for C\+\+ is available on the [AWS Code Examples Repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/cpp/example_code) on GitHub\. The following examples are a subset of what is available on Github\.


**Service examples with additional explanation \(see [AWS Code Examples Repository](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/cpp/example_code) for full list\)**  

| Service | Summary of what the service provides to your program | 
| --- | --- | 
| [Amazon CloudWatch](examples-cloudwatch.md) | Collects and monitors metrics for AWS resources you are using | 
| [Amazon DynamoDB](examples-dynamodb.md) | A NoSQL database service | 
| [Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud](examples-ec2.md) \(Amazon EC2\) | Secure, resizable compute capacity | 
| [AWS Identity and Access Management](examples-iam.md) \(IAM\) | Create and manage AWS users and groups, and use permissions to control access to AWS resources | 
| [Amazon Simple Storage Service](examples-s3.md) \(Amazon S3\) | Data storage and retrieval \(objects into buckets\) | 
| [Amazon Simple Queue Service](examples-sqs.md) \(Amazon SQS\) | Message queuing service to send, store, and receive messages between software components | 

There are also examples that show how to use [Asynchronous methods](async-methods.md)\.

To propose a new code example to the AWS documentation team, follow the guidance on the [Readme](https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/main/README.rst) on GitHub to create a new request\. The team prefers to create code examples that show broad scenarios rather than individual API calls\.

**Using the Code Examples on Windows**

If you are building the examples on Windows with SDK version 1\.9, see [Troubleshooting build issues](troubleshooting-cmake.md)\.
